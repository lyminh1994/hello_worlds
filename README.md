# hello_worlds

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## GetX Package

- GetX is a full-featured package that offers state management, dependency injection, and navigation management.
- It provides a simple syntax for reactive programming and offers an easy way to manage app state.

### Directory Structure with GetX

When using the GetX package for state management in Flutter, there is no strict requirement for a specific directory to
store your GetX-related files. However, you can follow a suggested approach to organize your GetX files within your
project's directory structure. Here's a recommended structure:

Create a directory for your GetX-related files:

- In the lib directory of your Flutter project, create a new directory to contain your GetX-related files. You can name
  it controllers, bindings, or any other suitable name.
  Controllers directory:
- Inside the GetX-related directory, create a controllers directory. This directory will hold your GetX controllers.
- Each GetX controller typically corresponds to a specific feature or module in your app.
- Create separate files for each controller. For example, you might have user_controller.dart, cart_controller.dart,
  theme_controller.dart, etc.
  Bindings directory (optional):
- If you're using GetX's Dependency Injection (DI) capabilities, you can create a bindings directory within the
  GetX-related directory.
- This directory will hold your GetX bindings, which are responsible for injecting dependencies and managing the
  lifecycle of controllers.
- Create separate files for each binding. For example, you might have user_binding.dart, cart_binding.dart, etc.
  Here's an example of how your directory structure might look:

```
your_flutter_project/
|- lib/
|    |- main.dart
|    |- screens/
|    |- widgets/
|    |- controllers/
|    |    |- user_controller.dart
|    |    |- cart_controller.dart
|    |    |- theme_controller.dart
|    |- bindings/
|    |    |- user_binding.dart
|    |    |- cart_binding.dart
|    |- ...
|
|- test/
|- pubspec.yaml
|- README.md
|- ...
```

By organizing your GetX-related files within separate directories, you can maintain a structured codebase that is easier
to navigate and manage. However, remember that the directory structure is flexible and can be adjusted based on your
project's needs and preferences.
